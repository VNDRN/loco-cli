## About

The **Loco CLI** helps you keep your translations bundled in your app/website in sync with [Loco](https://localise.biz).

## Getting Started

```
npx loco-cli --help
```

Loco CLI currently has three methods, which are very similar to git commands:

- `loco-cli push`: push asset ID's to Loco, so translators can start translating them.
- `loco-cli pull`: download all translations.
- `loco-cli status`: see which asset ID's are not yet uploaded/downloaded.

The Loco CLI assumes your translations are stored as **JSON** files, one for each language.

```
[locales folder]
 â”œâ”€â”€ en.json
 â”œâ”€â”€ es.json
 â””â”€â”€ fr.json
```

The keys in the files are asset ID's, and the values are translations. Nested JSON structures produce dottet asset ID's:

```jsonc
{
  "home": {
    "title": "Welcome back, {{name}}" // Asset ID: `home.title`
  }
}
```

### Config file

Global options are passed as options in the terminal or read from a `.locorc.{yaml,json,js}` file:

```jsonc
// .locorc.json
{
  "accessKey": "<loco-full-access-key>",
  "localesDir": "src/app/i18n/locales",
  "defaultLanguage": "en"
}
```

#### `accessKey`

or `-a, --access-key <key>`

The API key of the Loco project you wish to sync to/from. You can find this in the Loco project under `Developer Tools â€º API Keys â€º Full Access Key` (if you do not intend to use `loco-cli push`, an `Export key` will work too).

#### `localesDir`

or `-d, --locales-dir <path>`

The folder in which the JSON translation files are stored (defaults to current working dir).

#### `defaultLanguage`

or `-l, --default-language <lang>`

Loco CLI will use this language in the `push` and `status` commands to check which asset ID's are missing on Loco (default: `en`).

## Usage

### `loco-cli status`

Check the difference between local assets and remote assets. This command will show you which assets are present locally but not remotely and vice-versa.

### `loco-cli pull`

Download all translations from Loco. This command will **overwrite** the JSON files in `localesDir` with the assets found in Loco.

### `loco-cli push`

Push missing asset ID's to Loco. This command is useful for creating assets based on a reference JSON file.

#### Options

- `-t, --tag [tag]`: Tag for newly uploaded assets, e.g. "1.1.0"
- `-s, --status [status]`: Status for newly uploaded assets (default: "provisional")
